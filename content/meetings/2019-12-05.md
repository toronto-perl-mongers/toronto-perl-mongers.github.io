summary: December Social with Meta::Hack team
---

There is no November meeting planned -- instead, we'll be meeting a week later for our December
social, where we'll get a chance to meet some of the folks in town for the Perl Toolchain Summit.

I've set the meeting time at 630pm so that we can meet, have supper, have a drink -- it's a social,
just show up when you can. :)

PS This venue doesn't do reservations unless we're an organization, so please RSVP so I have a
number to give the host/hostess.
