summary: Hack-a-thon to clean up the TPM website
---

This month's meeting is a week early so as not to conflict with Halloween.

At Olaf's suggestion, we are going to be doing a hackathon to clean up the Toronto Perlmongers
website. Bring a laptop, and get ready to do some development for a few hours -- this is something
we haven't done in a while, so it should be fun. Here are some updates from Olaf:

To prepare for the event, you can follow this [tutorial on how to contribute to
perl.com](https://www.perl.com/article/how-to-write-your-first-article-for-perl-com/) That will get
you started with Hugo.

I don’t plan to prepare a presentation for this evening. It’s my hope that people can bring their
laptops with Hugo already installed and we can muddle through it together, hopefully learning
helpful things in the process.
