The Toronto Perl Mongers ([http://to.pm.org/](http://to.pm.org/)) is a long running user group for the Perl enthusiast
and the Perl-curious alike. This site is about the Perl programming language, especially for Perl
Programmers, but even if you are not a Perl Programmer, feel free to attend. Topics can range across
many areas including Perl-centric topics like web development, ORMs and NoSQL. We also look for
talks on other languages that our members use or have played with (like Lisp, Ruby, Scala, or Go) or
even further afield to Arduino and do-it-yourself Sous-vide (yes, that's cooking).
